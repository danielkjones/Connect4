This is a small ConnectFour game I put together in my free time for some 
fun practice with Model View Controller design and JavaFX.

Once you run the program you will get a graphical user interface with the Connect Four 
game board. It is currently a two player game but has room for adding more functionalities. 

The rules of the game are simple. Two people will alternate turns on the same device and
attempt to be the first player to get four pieces in a row (vertical, horizontal, or diagnol). 
If all the spaces are full, it's a tie game and you will have to restart. 

Enjoy!
